Git/GitHub 4 : Branch and flow 

## Summary
This is a WCS quest.

## Instructions 
1. Creates a new repo named website-flow on GitHub by checking "Initialize this repository with a README".
2. Clone the repo on your machine.
3. Locally (= via Git), create a new branch called cheese and enter it.
4. In your favourite text editor, edit the file readme (for example, by writing a list of your favourite pizza cheeses).
5. By making sure you're on the right track cheese commit your changes and push them to your GitHub repo.
6. On GitHub, merge the branch cheese to the branch master via a pull request, then delete the cheese branch.
7. As a solution to this challenge, share your GitHub repo link with /commits at the end
